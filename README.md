## A

[Appication Program Interface (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)  
- An Appication Program Interface is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation.

## C

[Command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)  
- A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor.  

[Crawler (web crawler)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)  
- A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).

## D

[Decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance)  
- Decentralized finance (commonly referred to as DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks to offer traditional financial instruments, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being Ethereum.

## F

[Functional programming (FP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)  
- In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.

## L

[Lint (or a Linter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))  
- lint, or a linter, is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code.

## M

[Model–view–controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)  
- Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.  

[Minimum viable product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)  
- A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.

## O

[Object-oriented programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).  

[Object-relational mapping (ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping)  
- Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.

## P

[Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20pipeline%2C%20also,or%20in%20time%2Dsliced%20fashion.)  
- In computing, a pipeline, also known as a data pipeline, is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one.  

[Progressive web application (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)  
- A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser.

## S

[Search engine optimization (SEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)  
- Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.  

[Server-side rendering (SSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)  
- Server-side scripting (Server-side rendering) is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customised for each user's (client's) request to the website.  

[Single-page application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)  
- A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages.  

[Snippet (programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming))  
- Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine code, or text.  

[Static site generators (SSG)](https://www.netguru.com/blog/what-are-static-site-generators)  
- A static site generator is essentially a set of tools for building static websites based on a set of input files.

## T

[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)  
- The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications. These best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web.  

[Toolchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain)  
- In software, a toolchain is a set of programming tools that is used to perform a complex software development task or to create a software product, which is typically another computer program or a set of related programs.

## V

[Version control systems (VCS)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)  
- If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
