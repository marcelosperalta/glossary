## A

[Application performance management (APM)]()
- In the fields of information technology and systems management, application performance management (APM) or application performance monitoring is the monitoring and management of performance and availability of software applications. APM strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to maintain an expected level of service. e.g. [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).

[Appication Program Interface (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)  
- An Appication Program Interface is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation.

## B

[Behavior-driven development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)  
- In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance testers, and customer representatives in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.  

[Boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code)  
- In computer programming, boilerplate code or just boilerplate are sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation. When using languages that are considered verbose, the programmer must write a lot of code to accomplish only minor functionality. Such code is called boilerplate.  

[Bundling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strapping)
- Strapping, also known as bundling and banding, is the process of applying a strap to an item to combine, stabilize, hold, reinforce, or fasten it. The strap may also be referred to as strapping. Strapping is most commonly used in the packaging industry.  

[Business logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic)
- In computer software, business logic or domain logic is the part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a database or displaying the user interface, system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.

## C

[Clean URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL)  
- Clean URLs, also sometimes referred to as RESTful URLs, user-friendly URLs, pretty URLs or search engine-friendly URLs, are URLs intended to improve the usability and accessibility of a website or web service by being immediately and intuitively meaningful to non-expert users. Such URL schemes tend to reflect the conceptual structure of a collection of information and decouple the user interface from a server's internal representation of information. Other reasons for using clean URLs include search engine optimization (SEO), conforming to the representational state transfer (REST) style of software architecture, and ensuring that individual web resources remain consistently at the same URL. This makes the World Wide Web a more stable and useful system, and allows more durable and reliable bookmarking of web resources.

[Command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)  
- A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor.  

[Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)  
- A content delivery network, or content distribution network (CDN), is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.  

[Content management system (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)  
- A content management system (CMS) is a computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. A CMS is typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM). A CMS typically has two major components: a content management application (CMA), as the front-end user interface that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, and remove content from a website without the intervention of a webmaster; and a content delivery application (CDA), that compiles the content and updates the website. e.g. [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/).

[Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)  
- In software engineering, CI/CD or CICD is the combined practices of continuous integration and either continuous delivery or continuous deployment. In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually. e.g. [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). 

[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. e.g. [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors).

[Crawler (web crawler)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)  
- A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).  

[Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)  
- In computer programming, Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations of persistent storage. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports. CRUD/SQL/HTTP: Create/INSERT/POST, Read/SELECT/GET, Update/UPDATE/PUT, and Delete/DELETE/DELETE.  

[Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.  

[Crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing)
- Crowdsourcing is a sourcing model in which individuals or organizations obtain goods or services—including ideas, voting, micro-tasks, and finances—from a large, relatively open, and often rapidly evolving group of participants.

[Crowdsourced testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_testing)  
- Crowdsourced testing (Crowdtesting) is an emerging trend in software testing which exploits the benefits, effectiveness, and efficiency of crowdsourcing and the cloud platform. It differs from traditional testing methods in that the testing is carried out by a number of different testers from different places, and not by hired consultants and professionals. The software is put to test under diverse realistic platforms which makes it more reliable, cost-effective, and can be fast. In addition, crowdsource testing can allow for remote usability testing because specific target groups can be recruited through the crowd. e.g. [Applause](https://www.applause.com/)

[CSS-in-JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS-in-JS)  
- CSS-in-JS is a styling technique where JavaScript is used to style components. When this JavaScript is parsed, CSS is generated (usually as a `<style>` element) and attached into the DOM. It allows to abstract CSS to the component level itself, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. e.g. [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/).

## D

[Data access object (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object)  
- In computer software, a data access object (DAO) is a pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database.  

[Data transfer object (DTO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object)  
- In the field of programming a data transfer object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services), where each call is an expensive operation. Because the majority of the cost of each call is related to the round-trip time between the client and the server, one way of reducing the number of calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data that would have been transferred by the several calls, but that is served by one call only.  

[Database management system (DBMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system)  
- Software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database.  

[Decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance)  
- Decentralized finance (commonly referred to as DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks to offer traditional financial instruments, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being Ethereum.  

[Document Object Model (DOM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/introduction.html)  
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.  

[Domain (software engineering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(software_engineering))  
- A domain is the targeted subject area of a computer program. It is a term used in software engineering. Formally it represents the target subject of a specific programming project, whether narrowly or broadly defined. For example, a particular programming project might have had as a goal, the creation of a program for a particular hospital, and that hospital would be the domain. Or the project could be expanded in scope to include _all hospitals_ as their domain.  In a computer programming design, you define a domain by delineating a set of common requirements, terminology, and functionality for any software program constructed to solve a problem in the area of computer programming, known as domain engineering. The word domain is also taken as a synonym of _application domain_.  

[Domain-driven design (DDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)  
- Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.  

[Don't repeat yourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)  
- "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY, or sometimes "do not repeat yourself") is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

## E

[Event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)  
- In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads. Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.

[Extreme programming (XP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming)  
- Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.

## F

[Functional programming (FP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)  
- In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.

## G

[Greenfield project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project)  
- In many disciplines, a greenfield project is one that lacks constraints imposed by prior work. The analogy is to that of construction on greenfield land where there is no need to work within the constraints of existing buildings or infrastructure. In software development, a greenfield project could be one of developing a system for a totally new environment, without concern for integrating with other systems, especially not legacy systems. Such projects are deemed higher risk, as they are often for new infrastructure, new customers, and even new owners.

## I

[Identity and access management (IAM or IdAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management)  
- Identity management (IdM), also known as identity and access management (IAM or IdAM), is a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the right users (in an enterprise) have the appropriate access to technology resources. IdM systems fall under the overarching umbrellas of IT security and data management.  

[Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service)  
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. e.g. [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

[Infrastructure as code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)  
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.  

[Integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
- An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Some IDEs, such as [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) and [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/), contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; others, such as [SharpDevelop](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop) and [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/), do not.

[IntelliSense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion#IntelliSense)  
- IntelliSense is Microsoft's implementation of code completion, best known in Visual Studio. It was first introduced as a feature of a mainstream Microsoft product in 1996 building on many already invented concepts of code completion and syntax checking, with the Visual Basic 5.0 Control Creation Edition, which was essentially a publicly available prototype for Visual Basic 5.0. IntelliSense is now supported by the Visual Studio editors for C++, C#, J#, Visual Basic, XML, HTML and XSLT among others.  

[Internationalization and localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)  
- In computing, internationalization and localization (American) or internationalisation and localisation (British English), often abbreviated i18n and L10n, are means of adapting computer software to different languages, regional peculiarities and technical requirements of a target locale. Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components. Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once before localization, or as an integral part of ongoing development). e.g. [LinguiJS](https://lingui.js.org/), [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/), [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/).

## K

[Kanban (development)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development))  
- Kanban (Japanese: 看板, meaning signboard or billboard) is a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks.

[Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)  
- KISS, an acronym for keep it simple, stupid, is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it simple and straightforward", "keep it small and simple", "keep it simple, soldier", "keep it simple, sailor", or "keep it sweet and simple".

## L

[Lean software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development)  
- Lean software development is a translation of lean manufacturing principles and practices to the software development domain. Adapted from the Toyota Production System, it is emerging with the support of a pro-lean subculture within the agile community. Lean offers a solid conceptual framework, values and principles, as well as good practices, derived from experience, that support agile organizations.

[Lint (or a Linter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))  
- lint, or a linter, is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. e.g. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [JSLint](https://www.jslint.com/).

## M

[Micro Frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html)  
- Micro frontends are all about slicing up big and scary things into smaller, more manageable pieces, and then being explicit about the dependencies between them. Our technology choices, our codebases, our teams, and our release processes should all be able to operate and evolve independently of each other, without excessive coordination.

[Minification (programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)#Web_development)  
- Minification (also minimisation or minimization) is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from the source code of interpreted programming languages or markup languages without changing its functionality. These unnecessary characters usually include white space characters, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block delimiters, which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute. Minification reduces the size of the source code, making its transmission over a network (e.g. the Internet) more efficient.

[Minimum viable product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)  
- A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. 

[Modal window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window)  
- In user interface design for computer applications, a modal window is a graphical control element subordinate to an application's main window. A modal window creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Modal windows are sometimes called **heavy windows** or **modal dialogs** because they often display a dialog box.

[Model–view–controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)  
- Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.   

[Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)  
- In version control systems, a monorepo ("mono" meaning 'single' and "repo" being short for 'repository') is a software development strategy where code for many projects is stored in the same repository. As of 2017, various forms of this software engineering practice were over two decades old, but the general concept had only recently been named. Many attempts have been made to differentiate between monolithic applications and other, newer forms of monorepos.

[Penetration test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test)
- A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test (pentesting) or ethical hacking, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system; this is not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment. The test is performed to identify weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

[Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20pipeline%2C%20also,or%20in%20time%2Dsliced%20fashion.)  
- In computing, a pipeline, also known as a data pipeline, is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one.  

[Platform as a service (PaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)  
- Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that allows customers to provision, instantiate, run, and manage a modular bundle comprising a computing platform and one or more applications, without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching the application(s); and to allow developers to create, develop, and package such software bundles. e.g. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift).

[Principle of least privilege (PoLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)  
- In information security, computer science, and other fields, the principle of least privilege (PoLP), also known as the principle of minimal privilege or the principle of least authority, requires that in a particular abstraction layer of a computing environment, every module (such as a process, a user, or a program, depending on the subject) must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.  

[Programming domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_domain)  
- The term programming domain is mostly used when referring to domain-specific programming languages. It refers to a set of programming languages or programming environments that were written specifically for a particular domain, where _domain_ means a broad subject for end users such as accounting or finance, or a category of program usage such as artificial intelligence or email. Languages and systems within a single programming domain would have functions common to the domain and may omit functions that are irrelevant to a domain.  

[Progressive web application (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)  
- A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser.

## R

[RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication (RSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)  
- RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.

[Regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)  
- A regular expression (shortened as **regex** or **regexp**; also referred to as **rational expression**) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. e.g. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/).

[Remote procedure call (RPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)  
- In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPCs are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures are largely the same whether they are local or remote, but usually they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.

[Representational state transfer (REST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)  
- Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasises the scalability of interactions between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a layered architecture to facilitate caching components to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.

[Request for Comments (RFC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)  
- A Request for Comments (RFC) is a publication from the Internet Society (ISOC) and its associated bodies, most prominently the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet.

[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)  
- A web API that obeys the REST constraints is informally described as RESTful. RESTful web APIs are typically loosely based on HTTP methods to access resources via URL-encoded parameters and the use of JSON or XML to transmit data.

[Revision Control System (RCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System)

## S

[Scrum sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_sprint)
- In scrum and other agile software development frameworks, a sprint is a repeatable fixed time-box during which a "Done" product of the highest possible value is created. Sprint lies at the core of the Sprint agile methodology and can be thought of as an event which wraps all other Scrum events like Daily Scrums, Scrum Review and Sprint Retrospective. Like all of scrum events, Sprint also has a maximum duration. Usually, a Sprint lasts for one month or less.

[Search engine optimization (SEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)  
- Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.  

[Semantic versioning (aka SemVer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)    
- Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. Semantic versioning (aka SemVer), is a widely adopted version scheme that uses a sequence of three digits (Major.Minor.Patch), an optional pre-release tag and optional build meta tag.  

[Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)  
- In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)  

[Serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing)  
- Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. Serverless computing does not hold resources in volatile memory; computing is rather done in short bursts with the results persisted to storage. e.g. [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

[Server-side rendering (SSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)  
- Server-side scripting (Server-side rendering) is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customised for each user's (client's) request to the website.  

[Single-page application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)  
- A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages.  

[Snippet (programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming))  
- Snippet is a programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine code, or text.  

[Software as a service (SaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)  
- Software as a service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft. SaaS applications are also known as on-demand software and Web-based/Web-hosted software. e.g. [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), [monday.com](https://monday.com/).

[Software development kit (SDK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit)  
- A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and perhaps a software framework. They are normally specific to a hardware platform and operating system combination. To create applications with advanced functionalities such as advertisements, push notifications, etc; most application software developers use specific software development kits.

[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)  
- In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.

[Solution stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack)
- In computing, a solution stack or software stack or tech stack is a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete platform such that no additional software is needed to support applications. Applications are said to "run on" or "run on top of" the resulting platform. Examples: Jamstack, LAMP, MEAN, MERN, MEVN.

[Source-code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor)
- A source-code editor is a text editor program designed specifically for editing source code of computer programs. It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an integrated development environment (IDE) or web browser. Source-code editors are a fundamental programming tool, as the fundamental job of programmers is to write and edit source code. e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).

[Stack overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow)
- In software, a stack overflow occurs if the call stack pointer exceeds the stack bound. The call stack may consist of a limited amount of address space, often determined at the start of the program. The size of the call stack depends on many factors, including the programming language, machine architecture, multi-threading, and amount of available memory. When a program attempts to use more space than is available on the call stack (that is, when it attempts to access memory beyond the call stack's bounds, which is essentially a buffer overflow), the stack is said to overflow, typically resulting in a program crash.

[Startup studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_studio)  
- A startup studio, also known as a startup factory, or a startup foundry, or a venture studio, or a venture builder is a studio-like company that aims at building several companies in succession. This style of business building is referred to as "parallel entrepreneurship".  

[Static program analysis](https://www.netguru.com/blog/what-are-static-site-generators)  
- Static program analysis (Static code analysis) is the analysis of computer software performed without executing any programs, in contrast with dynamic analysis, which is performed on programs during their execution. e.g. [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/).

[Static site generators (SSG)](https://www.netguru.com/blog/what-are-static-site-generators)  
- A static site generator is essentially a set of tools for building static websites based on a set of input files.  

[Static type checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking)  
- Static type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs.  

[Systems development life cycle (SDLC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle)  
- In systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the application development life-cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. The systems development life cycle concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both. There are usually six stages in this cycle: requirement analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.

## T

[Test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)  
- Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.  

[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)  
- The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications. These best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web.  

[Toolchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain)  
- In software, a toolchain is a set of programming tools that is used to perform a complex software development task or to create a software product, which is typically another computer program or a set of related programs.  

[Tweaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweaking#Software)  
- Software tweaking is the process of improving the performance of an application or the quality of its output. There can be two ways of accomplishing this: manually (that is, if one is familiar with programming; though it may be irrelevant if the source of the application is closed, and there are no built-in means to adjust its performance) or using another piece of software specialized for that purpose. Tweaking of this kind generally increases usability, in terms of personal configuration preferences, rather than objective performance of the system overall).  

[Type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference)  
- Type inference refers to the automatic detection of the type of an expression in a formal language. These include programming languages and mathematical type systems, but also natural languages in some branches of computer science and linguistics.

## U

[URL Slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug)  
- Some systems define a slug as the part of a URL that identifies a page in human-readable keywords. It is usually the end part of the URL (specifically of the path / pathinfo part), which can be interpreted as the name of the resource, similar to the basename in a filename or the title of a page. The name is based on the use of the word slug in the news media to indicate a short name given to an article for internal use.

[Vanilla JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Vanilla_JavaScript)  
- The term "Vanilla JS" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.

[Vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)  
- In economics, vendor lock-in, also known as proprietary lock-in or customer lock-in, makes a customer dependent on a vendor for products and services, unable to use another vendor without substantial switching costs. Lock-in costs that create barriers to market entry may result in antitrust action against a monopoly.  

[Version control systems (VCS)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)  
- If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
