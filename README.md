## A

[Appication Program Interface (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)  
- An Appication Program Interface is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation.

## B

[Boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code)  
- In computer programming, boilerplate code or just boilerplate are sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation. When using languages that are considered verbose, the programmer must write a lot of code to accomplish only minor functionality. Such code is called boilerplate.  

[Bundling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strapping)
- Strapping, also known as bundling and banding, is the process of applying a strap to an item to combine, stabilize, hold, reinforce, or fasten it. The strap may also be referred to as strapping. Strapping is most commonly used in the packaging industry.  

[Business logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic)
- In computer software, business logic or domain logic is the part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. It is contrasted with the remainder of the software that might be concerned with lower-level details of managing a database or displaying the user interface, system infrastructure, or generally connecting various parts of the program.

## C

[Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)  
- A content delivery network, or content distribution network (CDN), is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.  

[Content management system (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)  
- A content management system (CMS) is a computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. A CMS is typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM). A CMS typically has two major components: a content management application (CMA), as the front-end user interface that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify, and remove content from a website without the intervention of a webmaster; and a content delivery application (CDA), that compiles the content and updates the website.  

[Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)  
- In software engineering, CI/CD or CICD is the combined practices of continuous integration and either continuous delivery or continuous deployment. In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually.  

[Command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)  
- A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor.  

[Crawler (web crawler)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)  
- A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).  

[Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)  
- In computer programming, Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations of persistent storage. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports. CRUD/SQL/HTTP: Create/INSERT/POST, Read/SELECT/GET, Update/UPDATE/PUT, and Delete/DELETE/DELETE.  

[Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.

## D

[Data access object (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object)  
- In computer software, a data access object (DAO) is a pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database.  

[Data transfer object (DTO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object)  
- In the field of programming a data transfer object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services), where each call is an expensive operation. Because the majority of the cost of each call is related to the round-trip time between the client and the server, one way of reducing the number of calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data that would have been transferred by the several calls, but that is served by one call only.  

[Database management system (DBMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system)  
- Software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database.  

[Decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance)  
- Decentralized finance (commonly referred to as DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks to offer traditional financial instruments, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being Ethereum.  

[Document Object Model (DOM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/introduction.html)  
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.  

[Don't repeat yourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)  
- "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY, or sometimes "do not repeat yourself") is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

[Semantic versioning (aka SemVer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)    
- Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (major, minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. Semantic versioning (aka SemVer), is a widely adopted version scheme that uses a sequence of three digits (Major.Minor.Patch), an optional pre-release tag and optional build meta tag.  

[Serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing)  
- Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers.

## T

[Test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)  
- Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.  

[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)  
- The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications. These best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web.

[Tweaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweaking#Software)  
- Software tweaking is the process of improving the performance of an application or the quality of its output. There can be two ways of accomplishing this: manually (that is, if one is familiar with programming; though it may be irrelevant if the source of the application is closed, and there are no built-in means to adjust its performance) or using another piece of software specialized for that purpose. Tweaking of this kind generally increases usability, in terms of personal configuration preferences, rather than objective performance of the system overall).  

[Type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference)  
- Type inference refers to the automatic detection of the type of an expression in a formal language. These include programming languages and mathematical type systems, but also natural languages in some branches of computer science and linguistics.

## V

[Vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)  
- In economics, vendor lock-in, also known as proprietary lock-in or customer lock-in, makes a customer dependent on a vendor for products and services, unable to use another vendor without substantial switching costs. Lock-in costs that create barriers to market entry may result in antitrust action against a monopoly.  

[Version control systems (VCS)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)  
- If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
